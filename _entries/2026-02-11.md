lead_paragraph: "Jeffrey Edward Epstein was an American financier, child sex offender, and sex trafficker. He began his professional career as a teacher, being hired without a degree at the Dalton School. After his dismissal from the school in 1976, he entered the banking and finance sector, working at Bear Stearns in various roles, before starting his own firm. Epstein made much of his fortune by providing tax and estate services to billionaires, and cultivated an elite social circle. He and his accomplice, the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, procured underage girls and young women who were raped by him and, allegedly, some of his associates."
