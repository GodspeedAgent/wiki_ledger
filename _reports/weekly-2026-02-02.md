## Narrative

### Executive Summary

- The week is dominated by an **Epstein-related cluster** (*Epstein files* appearing twice; *Ghislaine Maxwell* appearing once), suggesting a single underlying story-thread pulling multiple adjacent lookups.
- Attention is “barbell-shaped”: one heavy, persistent story plus several unrelated one-day spikes (music, sport, internet infrastructure).
- Despite the intensity, the **lead sentences didn’t change** in this sample; the signal here is attention-routing, not article churn.
- The presence of an infrastructure term (*.xxx*) alongside celebrity/crime pages is consistent with “feed spillover”: people move from a primary story into curiosity-driven browsing.
- With only 6 entries, this is a **thin sample**—good for pattern sketches, not definitive claims.

### Observed Patterns

- **Repeat appearance:** *Epstein files* appears 2× in the same week.
- **Adjacency:** *Ghislaine Maxwell* appears in the same window as Epstein-related attention.
- **One-off spikes:** *Bad Bunny* (music), *Liam Rosenior* (sport), *.xxx* (internet) each appear once.

### Narrative Hypotheses

**Media Amplification Hypothesis**
- Observation: Epstein-related pages recur and “pull in” an adjacent page.
- Logic chain: a concentrated wave of coverage → people seek a neutral timeline/overview → Wikipedia serves as the shared reference.
- Alternative explanation: anniversary-style recirculation or algorithmic link placement (not necessarily a new event) could produce the same pattern.

**Agenda-Setting / Narrative Priming Hypothesis**
- Observation: one story dominates attention while unrelated topics still spike briefly.
- One interpretation is that a primary narrative occupies the foreground while lighter spikes act as background noise in the overall feed.
- Alternative explanation: this may simply reflect normal, decentralized curiosity with no coherent “set” agenda.

**Distraction Cycle Hypothesis (weak evidence)**
- Observation: the week mixes high-salience crime/abuse topics with entertainment and internet miscellany.
- This could indicate a collective oscillation between heavy and light content.
- Alternative explanation: the mix could be an artifact of the sampling method and the inherent diversity of top-pageviews.

### Psychological & Social Signals

- The Epstein cluster is consistent with **risk vigilance and moral salience**: people check names, networks, and timelines when a story resurfaces.
- The one-offs suggest routine **identity and fandom maintenance** (music/sport) continuing alongside heavier news.

### Media & Power Considerations

- Wikipedia often functions as the “shared citation layer” for breaking narratives; attention may reflect where media funnels audiences rather than raw grassroots interest.
- The adjacency effect (Epstein → Maxwell) may suggest the audience is mapping **networks and accountability structures**, not just consuming headlines.

### Counterpoints & Limitations

- Small n (6) and a weighted sampling method can overemphasize a single thread.
- Wikipedia pageviews are a proxy for **curiosity**, not agreement or endorsement.
- We can’t infer intent (coordination vs emergence) from pageview patterns alone.

### Questions for the Reader

- What kinds of media events reliably drive people to Wikipedia: new facts, or new framing of old facts?
- When a cluster forms (Epstein → adjacent pages), is the public trying to build a network map—or simply following hyperlinks?
- If a topic persists across weeks, does that reflect sustained relevance, or sustained amplification?
