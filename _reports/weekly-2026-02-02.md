## Narrative (LLM)

This week’s attention is dominated by a single gravity well: **Epstein-related topics** (e.g., *Epstein files*, *Ghislaine Maxwell*, *Jeffrey Epstein*). When a topic shows up repeatedly in a short window, it’s usually because a new document drop, legal filing, or media recap creates a fresh wave of curiosity — people jump to Wikipedia to get the “one screen” background.

The secondary spikes (entertainment/sports/internet infrastructure) are typical of a top-list feed: one-off bursts tied to a match result, a release, or a social-media moment.

What to watch next week: if the Epstein cluster persists, you’ll likely see **adjacent pages** rise too (named associates, related court cases, victims’ advocacy pages), which makes a good “connection map” for the report.
