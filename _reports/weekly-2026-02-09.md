## Narrative

This report covers a week that is still in progress, so treat it as an early read rather than a settled pattern.

So far the attention is concentrated on a single biography (*Jeffrey Epstein*). A common driver for this kind of spike is a fresh wave of coverage (document releases, legal developments, or renewed discussion) that sends people to Wikipedia for context and chronology.

As more days land in this week, the useful signal will be whether **adjacent pages** start appearing alongside it (related cases, named associates, institutions, locations). That clustering is usually where the “why now?” story becomes clearer.
